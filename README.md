# Stenodict

Stenodict aims to help shape how to use stenography in our modern world.
There is much more to text now than there ever was, between new
weird words, all the way to extended symbols such as emoji. We type cryptic
nonsense in the form of programming languages. We use function keys and movement
keys and modifiers and shortcuts. We have a whole set of problems
to deal with that the writers of olde never had to deal with.

If stenography is ever really going to replace a keyboard for everyday use,
people need to use shortcuts, commands, and preferably they shouldn't have to
reinvent the wheel each time they want to do something.

This repository is a set of free, open source stenographic dictionaries to help
you with the task of evolving beyond a traditional keyboard.
