## Why

Manage windows in Mac, easier and more powerful than ever, with Spectacle. Fully keyboard enabled, Spectacle controls well with Plover, and doesn't require remembering complex keyboard shortcuts.

## How

#### Spectacle

Get the [Mac Application](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)

#### Theory

Basically, left hand prefixes with `SP-`. Right hand makes the shape you want.

The right hand uses `FRPBLG` as a little "box".

`FR` will snap the window to the left half of the screen. `LG` is the right half. `FPL` is the top half of the screen, `RBG` is the bottom half.

Snapping to all four corners is just the corner two keys of the box: `FP`, `RB`, `PL`, and `BG`.

Full screen is all the box: `FRPBLG`. Centering is just the center column, `PB`.

Jump screens with the four keys on the side you want: `FRPB` moves left one screen, `RBLG` moves right one screen.
