## Why

Many speak a different flavour of English than the United States. Minimisxe your
frustration by synchronising Plover's behaviour with your own. Around 2300
entries from the default dictionary have been replaced, checking against a
wordlist of over 1700 words.

## How

Just add this dictionary to Plover's list, such that it takes precedence over
your core Plover dictionary (`dict.json` or `main.json`).
