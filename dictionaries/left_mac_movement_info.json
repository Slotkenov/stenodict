{ "filename": "left_mac_movement"
, "why": "This dictionary aims to solve the problem of moving the cursor around. Unlike Plover's default, this dictionary uses an arrow cluster made up of keys on the *left* side of the steno layout, in order to better simulate the WASD-cluster that you may be used to. This dictionary was designed on a Mac."
, "how":
  [ "`P-` is up, `W-` is down, `K-` is left, and `R-` is right."
  , "To move with any of the keys, you use either `P`, `W`, `K`, or `R` and `*RB`."
  , "To move by word (adding the Option key), the right hand becomes `*RBLT` (`LT` for \"Alt\".)"
  , "To select while moving (adding the Shift key), the right hand becomes `*RBLG`."
  , "To select and jump by word (Shift and Option), use `*RBLGS` on the right hand."
  , "To jump lines or to the top or bottom of the file (adding Command), use `*RPB`."
  , "Finally, for Control-Option combinations, use `*RLGTS` for the right hand."
