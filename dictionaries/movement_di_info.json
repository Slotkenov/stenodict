  [ "As per Plover's default, you use `-R`, `-P`, `-B`, and `-G` for left, up, down, and right."
  , "Use `STPH-` for moving by character, `STPH-RB` to jump a word left, and `STPH-BG` to jump a word right."
  , "Use `KPH-` to do Command, jumps line beginning and ending, top of file and bottom."
  , "Use `STP-` (**s**hi**f**t) or `SHR-` (**s**e**l**ect) to select with the movement keys. Again, `-RB` and `-BG` work by word."
  , "Use `PW*` and `-F`, `-FP`, or `-FPL` for backspacing a character, a word, or a line."
