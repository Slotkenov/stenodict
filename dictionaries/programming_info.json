  , "#### Current directory (spaced period)"
  , "Use the stroke `-P` to type a space, period, and space: ` . `. For example, `git add . ` is stroked `TKPWEUT/AD/-P`."
  , "#### Switches (` -` and ` --`)"
  , "To type a single hyphen switch, use `H*PB` => `H*N` (the brief for a hyphen with added star/asterisk), which will let you auto-insert a space as usual, type the hyphen, then suppress the next space. For example, `git commit -v` is stroked `TKPWEUT/KPHEUT/H*PB/SR*`."
  , "To type a double dash switch, use `TK*RB` => `D*SH` (the brief for a double dash or en&nbsp;dash with added star/asterisk), which will let you auto-insert a space as usual, type the double dashes, then suppress the next space. For example, `git diff --cached` is stroked `TKPWEUT/TKEUF/TK*RB/KAERBD`."
  , "#### Note:"
  , "This dictionary comes with an extra, flushed brief for `WUZ/WUZ` at the end. This entry has no trailing comma and is last alphabetically. As entries are added and the dictionary sorted, the final brief without a trailing comma remains at the end. This means it remains valid JSON, and plays nicely with versioning."
