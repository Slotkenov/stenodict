, "why": "The only reason that symbolic arrows aren't more widely used is the difficulty of activating them with a regular keyboard. Stenography allows us to make this trivially easy. Think of the pretty documents you could write, or the silly puns that you could make. All that's ← is for you to come ↑ with ideas of how to use them!"
, "how":
  [ "The strokes are defined based off of Plover's default arrow movements. For moving the cursor in Plover, you tend to use `STPH-` plus `RPBG` which acts as a WASD-like cluster. Quite simply, you use the keys like an arrow keypad, such that `R` is left \u2190, `P` is up \u2191, `B` is down \u2193, and `G` is right \u2192."
  , "With this dictionary, instead of moving the cursor, you want to create arrows. For this, the left hand makes the shape of an arrow with `KPR-` and the `RPBG` cluster. Additionally, if you press two directions in different axes, you will get the diagonal arrow. For example, `KPR-RP` is the up-left facing arrow (\u2196) because `R` is left and `P` is up."
  , "Those are the most intuitive strokes in this dictionary. You also get bidirectional arrows: up-down \u2195 is `KPR-PB`, left-right \u2194 is `KPR-RG`, and finally two arrows, one left and one right \u21c4, is `KPR-RBG`."
  , "*Bonus:* `R*URPB` (return) gives you \u21b5"
